# Skincare Plan for Oily Skin & Back Acne

---

## Daily Face Care Routine (Oily Skin)

### Morning
1. **Cleanser:** Salicylic acid (1–2%) — controls oil and unclogs pores  
2. **Serum (optional):** Niacinamide 5–10% — reduces oil and inflammation  
3. **Moisturizer:** Gel-based, oil-free — hydrates without clogging  
4. **Sunscreen:** SPF 30+ (matte finish) — prevents marks and oil flare-ups  

### Night
1. **Cleanser:** Same as morning — removes sweat, oil, dirt  
2. **Exfoliant (2–3x/week):** BHA (Salicylic acid) — clears pores, prevents breakouts  
3. **Spot treatment:** Benzoyl Peroxide (2.5–5%) — kills acne bacteria  
4. **Moisturizer:** Lightweight gel — balances after treatments
